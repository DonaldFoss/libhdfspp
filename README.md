libhdfs++
=========

libhdfs++ is a modern implementation of HDFS client in C++11. It is
optimized for the Massive Parallel Processing (MPP) applications that
access thousands of files concurrently in HDFS.

The highlights of libhdfs++ are:

  * Event-driven architectures
  * Zero-copy APIs
  * Use Continuation Passing Style to implement asynchronous APIs
  * Support Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
